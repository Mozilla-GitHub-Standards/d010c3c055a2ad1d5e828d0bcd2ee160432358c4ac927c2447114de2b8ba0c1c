(Still in development, don't rely on it just yet.)

The goal of this service is to integrate closely with the addons.mozilla.org
website (a.k.a AMO) to provide a way to register non AMO-listed addons as
a really simple process.

Have a look at http://addonreg.rtfd.org for more documentation on this service
